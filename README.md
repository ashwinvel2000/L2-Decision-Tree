##  What's Inside

`DecisionTree.ipynb` covers the full ML workflow:
1. **Importing Libraries**  
2. **Creating a Synthetic Dataset**  
3. **Data Preprocessing** (feature/target selection, train-test split)  
4. **Model Training** using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn`  
5. **Model Evaluation** with accuracy  
6. **Visualization** of the decision tree

##  Why This Notebook?

After 9 months of hands-on work in ML, I've realised the value of strong fundamentals. This notebook:
- Keeps things simple and clean
- Focuses on end-to-end model building
- Provides clear comments for learners
- Is designed to be run as-is with zero setup friction

If you're preparing for interviews, refreshing your basics, or mentoring others, this notebook can serve as a reliable starting point.
